# call-variants-dms-docker

## Purpose & Credits

This repository provides a **Dockerized version** of the `call_variants.py` workflow from the [barakcohenlab/crx-dms-manuscript](https://github.com/barakcohenlab/crx-dms-manuscript) repository.

>  **Original authorship and scientific implementation** of the variant-calling logic belongs to James Gagnon and the Barak Cohen Lab.
>  This repository **does not modify or reinterpret** the core logic.
>  My contribution is to **containerize** the environment (Python + Rust) and make the pipeline **portable and reproducible** for HPC and cloud use.
